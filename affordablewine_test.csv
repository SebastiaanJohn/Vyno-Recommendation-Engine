Vibrant and aromatic with delicious subtle perfumed aromas with white peach and hints of jasmine on the nose. On the palate it has tight, white, fleshy stone fruit and fresh apricot flavours that balances the sandy texture. Bright acidity and minerality helps to deliver a delicious flavoursome and characteristic wine.

Montresor Soave Classico is made from a blend of Garganega and Trebbiano di Soave grapes, cultivated in selected vineyards around the Soave hillsides and hand-picked in September.  The wine is held on lees for a few months and given a light filtration before bottling. An excellent example of good quality Soave Classico, fresh and lightly fruity with delicate floral aromas of honeysuckle, elderflower and a hint of spice. Crisp and refreshing on the palate with good depth of ripe honeyed fruit, and a dry, lightly nutty finish. A very versatile wine but excellent with simple fish such as grilled plaice or on its own well chilled as an aperitif. Also particularly good with Rissotti - simple herb versions are probably best.

This Riesling is made in the classic Mosel style, a lovely balance between ripe fruit sweetness and zingy, racy, fresh acidity. The wine has been fermented to a finished alcohol of 11%, so it’s slightly drier than typical Mosel Riesling which is usually 8.5%, but that makes this a better wine to drink with food as well as a lovely light, refreshing aperitif wine. The term Hochgewachs means a higher quality level up from standard QBA. Delicious on it’s own as an aperitif, but also an excellent match with Asian seafood dishes such as spicy squid or sweet and sour dishes, soft shell crabs and all manner of sushi. ﻿Awards: Silver Medal Winner - Sommelier Wine Awards 2017",Crisp|Fresh|Fruity,,,

The nose offers floral aromas of jasmine, lychee, and honey notes. The floral notes reappear on the palate, along with apricot, and mandarin orange. Medium bodied with good concentration and a refreshing ripe fruit finish. A Thai fighting delight! Its fruitiness makes this wine ideal as an aperitif served with mild cheeses, ham, and dried fruit and nuts. It is also excellent paired with sushi and fresh fruit desserts.

A small portion of the blend is aged in French oak barriques giving creaminess and complexity. The Cellar Selection Chardonnay has citrus and nectarine flavours backed up with sweet oak and lees-stirred complexity.  The flavour is of a genuine appley Chardonnay but with slight tropical notes at the back. This is a thorough-bred Chardonnay - no over-oaking here, and there is huge respect for this versatile grape. It is made in an easy drinking style, but will comfortably cellar for several more years.

This is a classic Chardonnay from Southern Burgundy - fine and buttery with floral notes on the nose.  A wine of substance and finesse on the palate. Some creamy textural notes up front reveal the discreet presence of oak, whilst on the finish there is some underlying minerality and a hint of citrus zestiness that provides long lasting flavours. An admirable accompaniment to the classic Burgundian dish of poulet à la crème (chicken in creamy sauce), or a shellfish chowder. Great with vegetable risotto and pan fried fish, too.

A proper white Côtes du Rhône; fresh, medium-bodied, vinous. The nose is pretty and delicate, with a waft of fennel tops and hints of hedgerow flowers. The flavours are nuanced and refined rather than overt. Careful use of oak adds texture and structure without masking the freshness of this very drinkable white.
