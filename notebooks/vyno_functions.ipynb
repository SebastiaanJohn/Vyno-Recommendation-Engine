Over the years many parcels have been replanted and the current incumbent, Laurent continues to do the same and the estate now covers 9 hectares. Both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are planted - seven hectares to Pinot Noir, and two to Chardonnay. The estate first started to bottle its own wines in 1975, and from one hundred bottles a year, it now bottles over 4,000 cases. The estate has won many awards for its wines, not only due to the attention paid to detail during the wine making process, but also to the estate's ruthless approach to quality control including severe pruning, green harvesting, lutte raisonn\\u00e9e (a form of organic agriculture) and selection by hand. The average age of the vines is now thirty years, organic fertilizers have been used for some years, and organic practices are embraced.\\u00a0The Grandes Vignes is raised in stainless steel tanks and is unoaked. A\\u00a0limpid pale gold\\u00a0in colour. Scents of honey and lemon with notes of lime. In the mouth, delicate and refined with a forward yet balanced acidity leading to a lingering and mellow finish.

Today the winery is run by Pedro Rodriguez who took over in the early 2000's. Over the ensuing years, Pedro came to embrace\\u00a0more traditional methods of wine making, while at the same time converting the estate to organic production, including using only wild yeasts during fermentation, treading grapes by foot and working with minimal sulphur. The resulting wines are now among the best in the appellation and highly sought-after.\\u00a0The Blanco is a blend of local grapes including Godello, Albarino and Treixadura and is unoaked. A bright straw-yellow in the glass. On the nose, fragrant and mineral with notes of green apples, citrus zest and almonds. On the palate,\\u00a0dry and smooth with a forward acidity and further stone fruit flavours leading to a lingering, slightly saline finish. Good with grilled sardines, goat's cheese tart or Merluza a la Gallega (hake with chorizo & potaoes).\", \n",

      "      \"description\": \"Jane Ventura is a family-run winery situated in the Catalonian region of Pened\\u00e8s near to the coast and just south of Barcelona. The estate was founded by Joseph Jane in 1914 and today the winery is run by 4 th generation wine maker, Gerard Jane Ubeda who continues the family philosophy of treating the vines and the resulting wines as a way of life while utilising the unique natural environment of Lower Penedes where his two wineries - Mas Vilella and Finca Els Camps - are located. The vines are planted at altitude (700 metres above sea level) and this, combined with the influence of the Mediterranean Sea enables the grapes to preserve their acidity and freshness. The Bianco Seleccio is a blend of four grape varieties from very old vines - Xarel-lo, Sauvignon, Muscat and Malvas\\u00eda de Sitges, all of which come from 15 different vineyards. Light and fresh, this pairs perfectly with grilled seafood. A straw yellow colour. Aromas lychee, pineapple, grapefruit and fennel. In the mouth, crisp and light with mineral notes leading to a surprisingly long finish. Great with braised rabbit in a mustard sauce, tuna steak with onions and tomatoes or a warm scallop and mange tout salad.\", \n",

The location, in the heart of a region that for many years was ravaged by civil war, placed demands on the Hochar family that most winemakers, fortunately, do not experience. The vineyards, which lie 30 miles east of Ghazir in the Bekaa Valley, were remarkably close to the frontline. Battle raged around the vines throughout the 1983 harvest, and Gaston's son, Serge Hochar had to be smuggled in by small boat to make the wine. Similar conditions were endured in 1988 and 1989, and during the latter year both the Hochar family home and the Chateau Musar winery suffered direct hits from shelling. For a short while the wine cellars served a dual purpose, as they made excellent bomb shelters for the local people. HPF is a blend of Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan with a splash of Grenache and is lightly oaked. A delightful cherry-red in colour, the nose is floral and aromatic with notes of cherries and strawberries. Very balanced and elegant on the palate with further summer red fruit flavours. The acidity is fresh and the finish lingering. Overall a wine of great finesse and not a little depth. Try with roast pork loin and garlic, sauteed chicken a la Bordelaise (with potatoes and fried onion rings) or an artichoke and wild mushroom salad.\", \n",

Pinot Grigio is one of the world's most popular grapes and is also known under the French name of Pinot Gris. Something of a chameleon of a grape, Pinot Grigio is produced in a range of styles from the light, fruity Italian style that has gained such enormous popularity, to a more mineral, flinty rich wine favoured by the French, particularly in Alsace. This classic example of the grape is crisp and fresh and makes for a great accompaniment to grilled fish and light pasta dishes. A very pale yellow in colour with green flecks. Aromas of green herbs, citrus fruits and green pepper. Bone-dry and refreshing on the palate with a sprightly acidity and a short yet clean finish. Try with pumpkin ravioli with sage butter, spaghetti with anchovy and oregano sauce or grilled trout stuffed with rosemary, thyme and garlic.\", \n",

      "      \"description\": \"The house was founded in 1966 by Jean-Paul Deville and is situated in the centre of the village of Verzy, just 20km south east of the Champagne capital, Reims. Since Jean-Paul's untimely death in 2013 the estate has been run by his wife Marie-Alice and his 4 sons who continue the family tradition of producing excellent Champagnes. What sets Jean-Paul's wines apart is the dominance of the Pinot Noir grape in the blend and this particular rose is made from predominantly Grand Cru Pinot Noir grapes and therefore represents fantastic value for money. This makes for an ideal aperitif and is a big JBW seller. A vibrant salmon-pink in colour. The mousse is persistent and lasting. On the nose aromas of summer red fruits leading to a refreshing and floral palate of cherries, blood orange and candied flowers. A very polished and well balanced fizz. Drink with fresh tuna sushi, fricassee of chicken and lobster with spring vegetables or escalope of salmon served on a bed of watercress and baby spinach.\", \n",

      "      \"description\": \"Mas de Libian is situated in the village of Saint-Marcel d'Ardeche in the southern Rhone Valley. The farm has been in the Thibon family since 1670 and today is presided over by Helene Thibon who took over in 1995. The estate has been organic for many years and biodynamic status was granted in 2005. The average age of the vines is 30 years and the vineyards are situated on south-facing terraced plots looking out towards Mont Ventoux. 'Cave Vinum' or 'beware of the wine' is a play on the Latin phrase 'Cave Canem' ('beware of the dog') to be found adorning the doors of various residences on ancient Pompeii. It is a blend of 40% Viognier, 40% Roussanne and 20% Clairette of which 20% is fermented in old oak barrels. Nothing to beware of here though, save the very limited availability of the wine. Early ordering recommended. A bright straw-yellow in colour. On the nose, notes of clementine, ginger and peach. On the palate, refreshing and mouthwatering with a rush of refreshing\\u00a0juiciness leading to a cleansing finish. Altogether a beautifully structured wine which pairs well with chicken tagine with prunes and apricots, Pad Thai with prawns or a venison stew with cream and juniper berries.\", \n",

      "      \"description\": \"Domaine du Monteillet was established in 1732 and is located above the village of Chavannay, near Condrieu. Today the estate is run by 10 th generation wine maker, Stephane Montez who studied in Australia, California and England before returning to take charge of the family domaine in 1997. He looks after vineyards in Condrieu, C\\u00f4te-R\\u00f4tie and Saint-Joseph. This delicious white is a blend of 58% Marsanne and 42% Roussanne from old vines and is aged in French oak barrels for 10 months. Packed with tropical fruit notes, this makes for a great Sunday lunch white with game or robust fish dishes. A medium-gold in colour. Aromas of almonds, melon and citrus. On the palate, typically oily and waxy in texture with toasty notes from the oak. The acidity is low and the finish long with a slight spice. Great food wine with Bouillabaisse, scampi Provencale or rabbit Pot Provencale with saffron-scented couscous.\", \n",
