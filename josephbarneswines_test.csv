Over the years many parcels have been replanted and the current incumbent, Laurent continues to do the same and the estate now covers 9 hectares. Both Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are planted - seven hectares to Pinot Noir, and two to Chardonnay. The estate first started to bottle its own wines in 1975, and from one hundred bottles a year, it now bottles over 4,000 cases. The estate has won many awards for its wines, not only due to the attention paid to detail during the wine making process, but also to the estate's ruthless approach to quality control including severe pruning, green harvesting, lutte raisonnée (a form of organic agriculture) and selection by hand. The average age of the vines is now thirty years, organic fertilizers have been used for some years, and organic practices are embraced. The Grandes Vignes is raised in stainless steel tanks and is unoaked. A limpid pale gold in colour. Scents of honey and lemon with notes of lime. In the mouth, delicate and refined with a forward yet balanced acidity leading to a lingering and mellow finish. Try with courgette and goat's cheese tart, butternut squash ravioli or roasted pork loin with an apricot glaze.",,,,

Today the winery is run by Pedro Rodriguez who took over in the early 2000's. Over the ensuing years, Pedro came to embrace more traditional methods of wine making, while at the same time converting the estate to organic production, including using only wild yeasts during fermentation, treading grapes by foot and working with minimal sulphur. The resulting wines are now among the best in the appellation and highly sought-after. The Blanco is a blend of local grapes including Godello, Albarino and Treixadura and is unoaked. A bright straw-yellow in the glass. On the nose, fragrant and mineral with notes of green apples, citrus zest and almonds. On the palate, dry and smooth with a forward acidity and further stone fruit flavours leading to a lingering, slightly saline finish. Good with grilled sardines, goat's cheese tart or Merluza a la Gallega (hake with chorizo & potaoes).",,,,

The estate was founded by Joseph Jane in 1914 and today the winery is run by 4 th generation wine maker, Gerard Jane Ubeda who continues the family philosophy of treating the vines and the resulting wines as a way of life while utilising the unique natural environment of Lower Penedes where his two wineries - Mas Vilella and Finca Els Camps - are located. The vines are planted at altitude (700 metres above sea level) and this, combined with the influence of the Mediterranean Sea enables the grapes to preserve their acidity and freshness. The Bianco Seleccio is a blend of four grape varieties from very old vines - Xarel-lo, Sauvignon, Muscat and Malvasía de Sitges, all of which come from 15 different vineyards. Light and fresh, this pairs perfectly with grilled seafood. A straw yellow colour. Aromas lychee, pineapple, grapefruit and fennel. In the mouth, crisp and light with mineral notes leading to a surprisingly long finish. Great with braised rabbit in a mustard sauce, tuna steak with onions and tomatoes or a warm scallop and mange tout salad.",,,,

Grown on a mixture of clay and limestone this crisp, dry white wine is a perfect foil to virtually any fish or seafood dish. A clear, light gold in colour. Fresh aromas of peaches, apricots and citrus fruits. The texture is very crisp with good acidity. The flavours are of stone fruits, white flowers with a dash of lemon and lime. Very bright and cleansing finish. Serve with linguine of crab and chilli, moules mariniere or a simple new potato salad.",,,,

The location, in the heart of a region that for many years was ravaged by civil war, placed demands on the Hochar family that most winemakers, fortunately, do not experience. The vineyards, which lie 30 miles east of Ghazir in the Bekaa Valley, were remarkably close to the frontline. Battle raged around the vines throughout the 1983 harvest, and Gaston's son, Serge Hochar had to be smuggled in by small boat to make the wine. Similar conditions were endured in 1988 and 1989, and during the latter year both the Hochar family home and the Chateau Musar winery suffered direct hits from shelling. For a short while the wine cellars served a dual purpose, as they made excellent bomb shelters for the local people. HPF is a blend of Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan with a splash of Grenache and is lightly oaked. A delightful cherry-red in colour, the nose is floral and aromatic with notes of cherries and strawberries. Very balanced and elegant on the palate with further summer red fruit flavours. The acidity is fresh and the finish lingering. Overall a wine of great finesse and not a little depth. Try with roast pork loin and garlic, sauteed chicken a la Bordelaise (with potatoes and fried onion rings) or an artichoke and wild mushroom salad.",,,,

Pinot Grigio is one of the world's most popular grapes and is also known under the French name of Pinot Gris. Something of a chameleon of a grape, Pinot Grigio is produced in a range of styles from the light, fruity Italian style that has gained such enormous popularity, to a more mineral, flinty rich wine favoured by the French, particularly in Alsace. This classic example of the grape is crisp and fresh and makes for a great accompaniment to grilled fish and light pasta dishes. A very pale yellow in colour with green flecks. Aromas of green herbs, citrus fruits and green pepper. Bone-dry and refreshing on the palate with a sprightly acidity and a short yet clean finish. Try with pumpkin ravioli with sage butter, spaghetti with anchovy and oregano sauce or grilled trout stuffed with rosemary, thyme and garlic.",,,,

This particular white is a blend of 70% Sauvignon and 30% Semillon aged in Allier oak barrels. The result is a round and buttery wine with beautifully integrated tannins. Pale gold in the glass. On the nose scents of honey, citrus fruits and quince. A full-bodied and complex palate of peach and apricot with a touch of spice from the oak. Excellent acidity with a firm tannic grip and a long, mineraly finish make this a versatile food wine. Great with roast duck and peaches, foie gras or an endive salad with smoked duck, girolles and cherry tomatoes.",,,,

Run very much along artisanal lines by Gregory Perez (the vineyards are ploughed by bulls), the vines are grown on clay and sandy soils at an altitude of 550 metres and the whole vinification process takes place, unusually, in one single barrel. A blend of primarily Godello and Doña Blanca aged in 500 litre foudres, this delicious white has the well defined minerality, brightness and subtle oak influence of good white Burgundy. A pale lemon in colour with greenish tints. Scents of lemon-edged chalky fruit. On the palate, fresh with a pronounced minerality. Bright, creamy tropical fruit flavours and rounded in texture. The finish is lingering. A real treat to drink.

Everything on the farm has been organic since 1993 and the produce reflects the landscape from which it comes.

Since Jean-Paul's untimely death in 2013 the estate has been run by his wife Marie-Alice and his 4 sons who continue the family tradition of producing excellent Champagnes. What sets Jean-Paul's wines apart is the dominance of the Pinot Noir grape in the blend and this particular rose is made from predominantly Grand Cru Pinot Noir grapes and therefore represents fantastic value for money. This makes for an ideal aperitif and is a big JBW seller. A vibrant salmon-pink in colour. The mousse is persistent and lasting. On the nose aromas of summer red fruits leading to a refreshing and floral palate of cherries, blood orange and candied flowers. A very polished and well balanced fizz. Drink with fresh tuna sushi, fricassee of chicken and lobster with spring vegetables or escalope of salmon served on a bed of watercress and baby spinach.",,,,

The average age of the vines is 30 years and the vineyards are situated on south-facing terraced plots looking out towards Mont Ventoux. 'Cave Vinum' or 'beware of the wine' is a play on the Latin phrase 'Cave Canem' ('beware of the dog') to be found adorning the doors of various residences on ancient Pompeii. It is a blend of 40% Viognier, 40% Roussanne and 20% Clairette of which 20% is fermented in old oak barrels. Nothing to beware of here though, save the very limited availability of the wine. Early ordering recommended. A bright straw-yellow in colour. On the nose, notes of clementine, ginger and peach. On the palate, refreshing and mouthwatering with a rush of refreshing juiciness leading to a cleansing finish. Altogether a beautifully structured wine which pairs well with chicken tagine with prunes and apricots, Pad Thai with prawns or a venison stew with cream and juniper berries.",,,,
